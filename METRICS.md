# VGO Metrics 1.0

**Reading copy:** https://www.vgoframework.org/docs/metrics  
**Version:** [v1.0.0-draft](https://github.com/vgoframework/vgo-framework/releases/tag/v1.0.0-draft)


VGO deliberately separates **raw metrics** from a **composite model**. Implementations should publish their exact measurement methodology.

## Visibility
- Search Visibility Share (SVS)
- Generative Mention Share (GMS)
- Citation Share (CS)
- Query/Prompt Coverage (QPC)
- Qualified Discovery Reach (QDR)

## Quality & authority
- Source Authority Mix (SAM)
- Citation Diversity (CD)
- Entity Consistency Rate (ECR)
- Factual Accuracy Rate (FAR)
- Contextual Relevance Rate (CRR)

## Integrity
- Poisoning/Anomaly Incidence (PAI)
- Untrusted Source Exposure (USE)
- False/Conflicting Claim Rate (FCR)
- Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)
- Mean Time to Correct/Recover (MTTC/R)

## Growth
- Visibility Growth Rate (VGR)
- Trusted Visibility Growth Rate (TVGR)
- Visibility-to-Outcome Conversion (VOC)

## Conceptual composite
`TVG = Reach × Relevance × Authority × Integrity × Persistence`

Do not present this conceptual equation as a universal scientific constant. Omseek or other implementations may operationalize each factor with disclosed weights, normalization and sampling rules.
